IN presenting the Second Volume of the York Breviary to our
Members, little need be said beyond the expression of satisfaction
at its completion.

At the‘ close of this Preface will be found a new Table of
the Contents of all the copies of our Breviary. It is intended to
take the place of the Table in the First Volume, which is less full
and less exact 1 owe this, and much more, to the kindness of
Mr. Bradshaw.¹

Of the five Appendices added at the end of this Volume, the
first four contain all that is not in the Bodleian copy, but that is to
be found in one (or more) of the other copies.

The fifth Appendix contains what we believe is a very valuable
addition—via, the Service and Legend of S. Richard de Harnpole.
Part of it has been printed before in the zoth Vol. of the Early
English Text Society²; but the transcript given now is much fuller
and more recent. The whole of this Appendix is of Mr. Procter's
doing, and the thanks 01 001 Society are due 10 him for his great
kindness in putting this new matter at our service. Certainly the
proper place for such an office as this 01 Hampole, would seem to
be among the pages of the Breviary 01 1110 Diocese. 1 cannot,
however, say whether or no it ever obtained any authority frorn
Pope or Archbishop. Mr. Procter has supplied the following
Introduction to this office :-

This office, prepared for the Commemoration of 'Richard (Rolle) the
hermit of Hampole-ifa decree for his canonization could be obtained-
