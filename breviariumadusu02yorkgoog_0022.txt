lt has the long Lection (in L, and inthis transcript, written as continuation
of lectio viii), but places it alter the Propria of the Mass : suggesting the
supposition that it was intended to be read as a lectio ad Primam in
capitulo. This MS. is referred to as C. ’

The Indexes will explain themselves. We believe that such
an attempt has never before been made; but ol its value we are
thoroughly convinced. By the comparison between different
Breviaries which such long lists facilitate, we may in time get to
some clearer knowledge of the families of these service-books.
And if in even the smallest degree we have contributed to such an
object, our drudgery will not have been in vain. The Index of
Versicles contains such as are said aster each Nocturn, the Versiculi
Sacerdotis, those said aster the Hymns, and those used in the
Memorie Sometimes a Versicle which is not in this Index will be
referred to by catchwords. Under such circumstances it will be
found either among the Anthems or Responsories. Sometimes
also an Anthem or Responsory is used asa Capitulum.
