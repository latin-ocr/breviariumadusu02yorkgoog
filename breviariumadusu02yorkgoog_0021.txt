is formed from three MS. copies, of which no single one is perfect, and no

(13ch1 liis known to exist. Tm knowledge of two of these is due to Mr. H.
ra s aw.

I. The Lincoln MS. is one of the treasures in the library belonging to
the Dean and Chapter of Lincoln.

The volume consists of two MSS. bound together.

The first part, beautifully written by John Wodeburgh, contains :-

(i.) Legenda de vita sei Ricardi de Hampole,>similiter cum ἕ
[cetero] proprio officio.

(ii) Item libellus ejusdem sei Ricardi de amore Dei contra amatores

(iii.) Itelrlhultigillus seu tractatus ejusdem super lectiones defunctorum.

(iiii.) Iteltentaissfiffiff ejusdem super Psalmum Dne in virtute tua

This volume has lost one or perhaps two entire leaves, and the lower
portion of another leaf: both of these lacuna are in No. 1., which is this
Office of Richard the hermit Otherwise John Wodeburgh's volume was
perfect and legible until a few years ago, when, in an attempt to transcribe
a portion of it for the F. E. T. S. (No. ao), the first leaf entirely, and words
in other places, were blackened by misuse of chemicals.

Τὴε portion of Hampole's Oflice containing the Vespers is talren from
that very imperfect copy—compared as far as possible with the MS, and
corrected and gaps supplied from the Cotton MS. This MS. is referred
toas 1.

The second part, or full half of the present volume of the Lincoln MS.
contains Richard’s treatise ‘Melos Amoris! A leaf is wanting at the
beginning. The MS. is written in avery different hand ; it is in double
columns, aud extends to 110 leaves.

Il. The MS. in the Bodleian Library (e Mus 193) has this Office
bound up with other matter. 1t has lost its first leaves, which probably
contained the Vespers; as the present fol. r commences with the first

Psalm of Complctorium. The Psalms are written at full length in all the
Offices : and the Antiphons are written as they were to be said or sung-
ἐι, the opening words before the Psalm, and the whole Antiphon after the
Psalm.

This MS. does not contain the long addition to Lect viii, and it has
not the ferial Antiphons and Responsories at the end of the ferial Lections;
but it has the Service of Compline at full length, which is not mentioned in
the Lincoln MS. This is referred to as B.

III. The MS. in the British Museum (Cotton. Tiberius A. xv.) is in
one of the scorched volumen This office is in the latter part of the
volume. It supplies words or portioris where the Lincoln MS. is spoiled
